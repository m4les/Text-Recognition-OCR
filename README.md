# Text-Recognition-OCR
Recognizes text, it may also correct grammar.

This project uses PaddleOCR to accurately detect text from images with high accuracy. It's designed to be simple, portable, and fast. 
It first extracts the text with PaddleOCR, seperates the words, and then corrects grammar for higher accuracy. It works with screenshots, pngs, etc.
It may take 3 - 5 minutes to load upon startup.

Now, this is meant for printed text, so it performs much better on things such as street signs or screenshotted PDFs, but it can still recognize handwriting to a good degree of accuracy.

There are some better OCR programs made by professionals, obviously, but I think for a first attempt this is pretty great
